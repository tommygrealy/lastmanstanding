<h3>Competition Rules</h3>
<A href="#paymentPage">Pay</A> your entry fee at week 1 — no need to pay again. All money collected through entry fees go into the pot to be won.
Each week, simply pick a team playing a match that week – 
if your team wins, you go through, lose or draw and you’re out.
You can only pick the same team once in the competition, 
so be tactical about who you pick and when.
All selections must be in 1 hour before kick off of the first match 
— you can change your selection any time up to this deadline by logging on to the competition website and selecting "cancel prediction".
In the event that you do not submit a team, the top team from an alphabetically ordered list (note spellings as per official league website).
 of the teams which are still available to you will be selected for you.

The competition continues until only one person remains and wins the pot. 
If all remaining players loose in the same round, they all go through to the next round.
