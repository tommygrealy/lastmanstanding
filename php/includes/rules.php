<h3>Competition Rules</h3>
<A href="#paymentPage">Pay</A> your entry fee at week 1 — no need to pay again. 50% of the fee 
goes to support our chosen <a href="#charity">charity</a> and the 
rest goes into the pot to be won.
Each week, simply pick a team playing a match that week – 
if your team wins, you go through, lose or draw and you’re out.
You can only pick a team to win once in a competition, 
so be tactical about who you pick and when.
All selections must be in 1 hour before kick off of the first match 
— once you submit a team, you can <u>NOT</u> change your selection.
If you forget to pick a team, we’ll randomly pick one for you for that round.
The competition continues until only one person remains and wins the pot. 
If two participants remain at the end, the pot is equally distributed; 
however, if more than two remain everyone goes through to the next round. 
If all remaining players lose in the last round, they all go through to the next round.
