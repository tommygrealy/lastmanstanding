lastmanstanding
===============
A simple football competition which uses the "Last Man Standing" format to eliminate users based on a single match selection per week.
Uses a MySql backend DB, PHP and Jquery Mobile. 
The UI is optomised for mobile display. There is no "desktop" theme. Desktop browsers will simply show the mobile version
(which may look a bit bare!)
